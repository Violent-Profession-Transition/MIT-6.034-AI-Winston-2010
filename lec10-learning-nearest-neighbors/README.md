### Introduction to Learning

Today's materials are quite easy.

First lecture on learning, followed by discussion on sleep

There are **two kinds of learning:**
1. **Bulldozer Computing** --> learning based on observations of regularity. computers are particularly good at regularity
    - **Pattern Recognition** --> Nearest Neighbors --> have been around for a long time, it is the things taught in 18.01 (single variable calculus), and is extremely useful. It is the first thing to try when you have a learning problem, because it is the simplest thing (try simple things first so you can understand)
    - **Mimic biology** --> Neural Nets
    - **Gift of the theoreticians** --> Boosting
2. **Humanlike** --> learning ideas based on constraints
    - **learn something definite from each experience** --> one-shot learning
    - Explanation-based learning


AI has borrowed, stolen, improved, invented some stuff, that is why our discussion of learning will reach around all of these topics
