# MIT-6.034-AI-Winston-2010
Pharmacy Meets AI

## Lecture 1 Overview (Week 1 Feb062021)

Covenant Number 1: No laptops, please

AI has to do with **thinking** (whatever that is)

AI is not only about thinking, it is also about **perception and action**

In an engieering scope, AI is about **models targeted at thinking, perception and action**

Model making is what MIT is about:
> We build models using differential equations. We build models using probabilities. We build models using physical and computational simulations.
> ... Models to explain the past and predict the future, understand the subject, and control the world.

If I take this class, will I get smarter? Yes. Because you will have better models of your own thinking.

**In order to have a model, you have to have representation**

AI = representations that support the making of models targeted at thinking, perception, and action.

What is a representation?

### Farmer, Fox, Goose, and Grain Problem

Representations and graph. 2^4=16 possible representations of the situations.

**Constraints exposed** due to the right representations, just like algebra
